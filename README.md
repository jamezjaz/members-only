# Members Only

> This is a project from The Odin Project (https://theodinproject.com)

In this project, we built an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. Hence, users can only see the author(s) of post(s)only if they're logged in.

- This was a practice project to introduce us to Devise gem.

- We created the Post model/controller and associated views.

- We created a form to create a post

- We used Devise to create the User model with authentications

- We changed the Devise User model to accept a name

- We created the logic to display user name if logged in
_ We also styled with CSS and bootstrap
